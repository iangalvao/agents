      "\n",
      "1. **Carlos Chagas (1879–1934)** – A physician and bacteriologist, Chagas discovered **Chagas disease** (American trypanosomiasis), caused by the parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi*. He identified the pathogen, vector (kissing bugs), symptoms, and epidemiology, making it one of the first complete descriptions of a tropical disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **César Lattes (1924–2005)** – A physicist, Lattes played a crucial role in the discovery of the **pion (pi-meson)**, a subatomic particle, in 1947. His work contributed to advancements in particle physics, and he helped establish Brazil’s scientific infrastructure, including the **Brazilian Center for Physical Research (CBPF)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Suzana Herculano-Houzel (b. 1972)** – A neuroscientist known for her research on the **human brain and neuron count**. She developed a method to count brain cells and showed that the human brain has about **86 billion neurons**, disproving earlier assumptions. She also studies brain evolution across species.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other notable mentions include **Mário Schenberg** (physicist), **Oswaldo Cruz** (public health pioneer), and **Miguel Nicolelis** (neuroscientist known for brain-machine interfaces). Would you like more details on any of them?\n"
